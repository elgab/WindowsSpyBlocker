## About

**WindowsSpyBlocker** is a set of rules to block Windows spy / telemetry based on multiple tools to [capture traffic](../../wiki/Capture%20traffic). It is open for everyone and if you want to contribute, take a look at the [Wiki](../../wiki).<br />
To be notified of new releases you can subscribe to this [Atom feed](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/releases.atom).

## How ?

I use a QEMU virtual machines on the server virtualization management platform [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) based on :

* Windows 10 Pro 64bits with automatic updates enabled.
* Windows 8.1 Pro 64bits with automatic updates enabled.
* Windows 7 SP1 Pro 64bits with automatic updates enabled.

I clean traffic dumps every day and compare results with the current rules to add / remove some hosts or firewall rules.

Tools used to capture traffic :
* **qemu -net dump** : capture
* **[Wireshark](../../wiki/captureWireshark)** : capture + logs
* **[Sysmon](../../wiki/captureSysmon)** : capture + logs
* **[Proxifier](../../wiki/captureProxifier)** : logs

All traffic events are available in the [logs](#logs) folder.

## Usage

### Data

`data` is the master folder of this project. It contains the blocking rules based on domain names or IPs addresses detected during the capture process.
* `data/<type>/winX/spy.txt` : Block Windows Spy / Telemetry
* `data/<type>/winX/update.txt` : Block Windows Update
* `data/<type>/winX/extra.txt` : Block third party applications

#### Hosts

Copy / paste the content of the files in `data/hosts` in your Windows hosts file located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.<br />

You can use the [HostsMan](http://www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman) freeware to keep update your hosts file.<br />
I have created a git hook to publish the hosts files to my personal website :

##### Windows 7
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win7/spy.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win7/spy.txt)
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win7/update.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win7/update.txt)
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win7/extra.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win7/extra.txt)

##### Windows 8.1
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win81/spy.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win81/spy.txt)
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win81/update.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win81/update.txt)
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win81/extra.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win81/extra.txt)

##### Windows 10
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win10/spy.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win10/spy.txt)
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win10/update.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win10/update.txt)
* [http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win10/extra.txt](http://www.crazyws.fr/WindowsSpyBlocker/hosts/win10/extra.txt)

#### Firewall

Some queries use IP addresses but you can stop them with your Firewall.<br />
All relative information about these IP addresses are listed in the CSV files `firewall-` in the [logs folder](logs).<br />
To add / remove firewall rules or test IPs, read the instructions in [scripts/firewall folder](scripts/firewall).

#### NCSI (Network Connectivity Status Indicator)

Windows check a Microsoft site for connectivity, using the Network Connectivity Status Indicator site.<br />
NCSI performs a DNS lookup on `www.msftncsi.com` and sends a DNS lookup request for `dns.msftncsi.com`.<br />
You can block this probe by adding the content of the `data/<type>/winX/extra.txt` hosts file.<br />

But you will have a ["No Internet access" warning in your system tray](../../wiki/FAQ#no-internet-access-on-my-network-card).<br />
To solve this problem you can use the alternative WindowsSpyBlcoker NCSI. Read the instructions in [scripts/ncsi folder](scripts/ncsi).

#### DNSCrypt

[DNSCrypt](https://dnscrypt.org/) is a protocol for securing communications between a client and a DNS resolver. With this tool you can blacklist some domains with the plugin [libdcplugin_example_ldns_blocking](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy#plugins) and add domains with leading and trailing wildcards.<br />
To install DNSCrypt on Windows, read the [README-WINDOWS](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/README-WINDOWS.markdown) on the official GitHub repository.<br />
Copy the content of the dnscrypt files in the repository in a file called for example `C:\blacklisted-domains.txt` and enter this command :

```
dnscrypt-proxy -R <name> --plugin=libdcplugin_example_ldns_blocking.dll,--domains=C:\blacklisted-domains.txt
```

Replace `<name>` with a [public DNS resolvers supporting DNSCrypt](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv) you want to use. Note its name, in the first column (for example: `dnscrypt.org-fr`).

#### Proxifier

Some hosts are not blocked and required a top level application.<br />
For example you can use [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/) software to block Microsoft spy.<br />
Copy the content of the proxifier files in `data/proxifier` in a blocked rule :

### Logs

Logs of tools used to capture traffic and resolution of firewall rules in CSV format available in the [logs folder](logs).
* `*-all.csv` : all events
* `*-hosts-count.csv` : number of events per host
* `*-unique.csv` : first trigger of an event per host / process / destination port

### Scripts

Several scripts are used to ease implementation of rules and contribution. To use these scripts you have to download and install the [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679) (vcredist_x86.exe).
* `diff.bat` : Generate a diff log based on CSV logs and data for Sysmon, Proxifier and Wireshark.
* `firewall.bat` : Add / remove rules and resolve IPs adresses
* `ncsi.bat` : Apply an alternate NCSI and test your internet connection the Micrososft way. More info on the [FAQ Wiki page](../../wiki/FAQ#what-is-ncsi-).
* `proxifier.bat` : Extract events from log and generate CSV files. More info on the [Proxifier Wiki page](../../wiki/captureProxifier)
* `sysmon.bat` : Install / uninstall Sysmon and extract events log then generate CSV files. More info on the [Sysmon Wiki page](../../wiki/captureSysmon)
* `wireshark.bat` : Extract events log then generate CSV files based on IPv4 hosts. More info on the [Wireshark Wiki page](../../wiki/captureWireshark)

## Projects using WindowsSpyBlocker

* [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) : A black hole for Internet advertisements (designed for Raspberry Pi).
* [StopAd](http://stopad.generate.club/) : Service for MikroTik routers made to block "advertising" and more.
* [OpenWrt adblock package](https://github.com/openwrt/packages/tree/master/net/adblock/files) : DNS based ad/abuse domain blocking
