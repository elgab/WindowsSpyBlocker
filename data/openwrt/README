DNS/IP block rules using dnsmasq/iptables, focused on latest OpenWrt release (Chaos Calmer 15.05.1).
opt-in approach: all 3 segments of hosts and IP ranges included, comment what you really need e.g: updates.

Requires package "iptables-mod-nat-extra" for port 53 (DNS) redirect rule from dnsmasq.conf
dnsmasq.conf is bypassed if you use dnscrypt on client machine (recommended) so use hosts before dnscrypt exit point.

dnscrypt is also available in openwrt repo, but may be slow and CPU hungry on average routers,
stay with the PC client as recommended.
